**Movie Genre Classification**
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am currently an intern at Codsoft, where I am participating in a machine learning internship program. This repository contains the code and documentation for my first task: Movie Genre Classification.

**Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to classify movies into different genres based on their textual descriptions. This task involves extensive data processing and modeling using machine learning algorithms.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project consists entirely of text data. Processing this data presented several challenges, particularly in terms of cleaning and feature extraction.

**Data Processing**
Data processing steps included:

Text cleaning (removing punctuation, stop words, etc.)
Tokenization
Vectorization (converting text to numerical features)

**Models Used**
Two machine learning models were employed for this classification task:

Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression

**Results**
The accuracy achieved with each model is as follows:

**Naive Bayes:** 43.4%
**Logistic Regression:** 56.6%
